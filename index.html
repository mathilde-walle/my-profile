			<h2>Rugby</h2>
			<p>
			I play rugby for some part of my life, that is a sport that I really enjoyed to practice ans I think that it has somewhat made me the way I am today. It taught me discipline, effort and working hard to succeed in what you want.

			<h2>Travel</h2>
			<p>
			I've been traveling one every year with my mother since I was a child, she made sure that I learned foreign cultures, languages. My favorites city is London, we try to go there one a year because we really fall in love with this city.
